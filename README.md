## Run a Single Part's Solution

```bash
npx ts-node ./src/{year}/day-{day number}/part-{part number}
```

e.g.

```bash
npx ts-node ./src/2022/day-1/part-1.ts
```

## Run All Solutions

```bash
yarn run solve
```

### Permission Denied

If you get a `permission denied` error after running the `solve` command, run:

```bash
chmod u+r+x ./src/run-all-solutions.sh
```

to grant read and execute permissions to the script.
